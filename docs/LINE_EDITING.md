# Line Editing in Den Shell

A comprehensive guide to Den's line editing capabilities, including word navigation, text manipulation, and history search.

## Overview

Den provides a powerful line editor with Emacs/Readline-style keybindings. All features work seamlessly together, making command-line editing fast and intuitive.

**Philosophy:** Learn once, use everywhere. Den follows the same keybindings as bash, zsh, and most Unix tools.

## Word Navigation

### Overview

Jump between words instead of moving character-by-character. Dramatically speeds up editing long commands.

### Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+Left` | Jump backward one word |
| `Ctrl+Right` | Jump forward one word |
| `Alt+B` | Jump backward one word (Emacs style) |
| `Alt+F` | Jump forward one word (Emacs style) |

### How It Works

Den treats whitespace as word boundaries. Navigation jumps to the start of the previous/next word.

```bash
den> git commit -m "Add new feature"
     ^   ^      ^  ^   ^   ^
     word boundaries
```

### Examples

#### Example 1: Navigate Backward
```bash
den> git commit -m "fix authentication bug"
                                          ^cursor at end

# Press Ctrl+Left once
den> git commit -m "fix authentication bug"
                               ^jumped to "bug"

# Press Ctrl+Left again
den> git commit -m "fix authentication bug"
                       ^jumped to "authentication"

# Press Ctrl+Left again
den> git commit -m "fix authentication bug"
                   ^jumped to "fix"
```

#### Example 2: Navigate Forward
```bash
den> git commit -m "update dependencies"
     ^cursor at start

# Press Ctrl+Right once
den> git commit -m "update dependencies"
         ^jumped to "commit"

# Press Ctrl+Right again
den> git commit -m "update dependencies"
                ^jumped to "-m"
```

#### Example 3: Fix Mistakes Quickly
```bash
# Oops, wrong command in the middle
den> git commit -m "fix bug in authentication"
                                             ^cursor here

# Jump back to "commit"
# Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Left
den> git commit -m "fix bug in authentication"
         ^

# Delete "commit" (Ctrl+W)
den> git -m "fix bug in authentication"
         ^

# Type "push"
den> git push -m "fix bug in authentication"
              ^
```

### Tips & Tricks

- **Combine with deletion:** Use Ctrl+W after navigating backward to delete specific words
- **Alt vs Ctrl:** Both work the same - use whichever is more comfortable
- **Works everywhere:** Same behavior as bash, zsh, emacs, readline

---

## Word Deletion

### Delete Word Backward (Ctrl+W)

Deletes from cursor position back to the start of the current/previous word.

```bash
den> git commit --amend
                       ^cursor here

# Press Ctrl+W
den> git commit
                ^deleted "--amend"

# Press Ctrl+W again
den> git
         ^deleted "commit"
```

**Use case:** Remove the last word you typed without backspacing character-by-character.

### Delete Word Forward (Alt+D)

Deletes from cursor position forward to the end of the next word.

```bash
den> git commit -m "fix typo error in function"
                       ^cursor here

# Press Alt+D
den> git commit -m "fix  error in function"
                       ^deleted "typo "

# Press Alt+D again
den> git commit -m "fix  in function"
                       ^deleted "error "
```

**Use case:** Remove words ahead of the cursor without selecting or cutting.

### Combining Forward and Backward Deletion

```bash
# Original command
den> echo one two three four five six
              ^cursor on "two"

# Delete "two" (Alt+D)
den> echo one  three four five six
              ^

# Delete "one " (Ctrl+W)
den> echo  three four five six
          ^

# Result: Removed "one two" efficiently
```

### Delete vs Kill

Den implements true deletion:
- **Ctrl+W** / **Alt+D**: Delete text (no clipboard)
- **Ctrl+U** / **Ctrl+K**: Kill text (may support yank in future)

## Character Transposition

### Overview

Ctrl+T swaps the character before the cursor with the character at the cursor. Perfect for fixing common typing mistakes.

### Keybinding

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+T` | Transpose (swap) characters |

### Behavior

1. **In the middle of a line:** Swaps char before cursor with char at cursor, moves cursor forward
2. **At the end of a line:** Swaps the last two characters

### Examples

#### Example 1: Fix "teh" → "the"
```bash
den> echo teh world
          ^h cursor after 'h'

# Press Ctrl+T
den> echo the world
         ^e cursor moved forward
```

#### Example 2: Fix at End of Line
```bash
den> echo hello wordl
                     ^cursor at end

# Press Ctrl+T (swaps 'd' and 'l')
den> echo hello world
                     ^fixed!
```

#### Example 3: Multiple Transpositions
```bash
# Multiple typos
den> echo hte owrld
          ^cursor after 't'

# Press Ctrl+T
den> echo the owrld
         ^fixed "hte" → "the"

# Move to 'r' position
# Ctrl+Right, Ctrl+Right, Right, Right
den> echo the owrld
              ^cursor after 'r'

# Press Ctrl+T
den> echo the world
             ^fixed "owrld" → "world"
```

#### Example 4: Common Mistakes Fixed Instantly

| Before | After | Keystrokes |
|--------|-------|------------|
| `comit` | `commit` | Ctrl+T |
| `recieve` | `receive` | (navigate) Ctrl+T |
| `tset` | `test` | Ctrl+T Ctrl+T |

### Tips & Tricks

- **Fastest typo fix:** For transposed letters, Ctrl+T is faster than backspace+retype
- **Works on letters, numbers, symbols:** Any characters can be swapped
- **Combine with word navigation:** Jump to the typo, press Ctrl+T, done!

## Screen Management

### Clear Screen (Ctrl+L)

Clears the terminal screen and redraws the prompt with your current command intact.

### Keybinding

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear screen and redraw prompt |

### Behavior

1. Clears entire terminal screen (like `clear` command)
2. Moves cursor to top-left of terminal
3. Redraws the prompt
4. Restores your current input buffer
5. Maintains cursor position within the buffer

### Example

```bash
# After running many commands...
den> ls -la
total 128
drwxr-xr-x  15 user  staff   480 Nov  9 10:30 .
drwxr-xr-x  20 user  staff   640 Nov  8 15:22 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 user  staff  1234 Nov  9 09:15 file1.txt
[... 50 more lines of output ...]

den> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
[... more output ...]

den> git commit -m "work in progress"
                               ^typing this

# Press Ctrl+L - screen clears instantly

# New clean screen:
den> git commit -m "work in progress"
                               ^cursor position preserved
```

### Use Cases

- **Before important output:** Clear clutter before running a command with important output
- **During long sessions:** Keep terminal clean and readable
- **Presentation mode:** Clean screen for demos or pair programming
- **Privacy:** Clear sensitive information from view

### Tips & Tricks

- **History preserved:** Clearing screen doesn't clear command history
- **Command preserved:** Current typing is never lost
- **Fast refresh:** Much faster than typing `clear` + re-typing command
- **Works mid-edit:** Can clear screen while editing a long command

### Clear vs Ctrl+L

| Action | Command | Ctrl+L |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Clear screen | ✓ | ✓ |
| Preserve current input | ✗ | ✓ |
| History preserved | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cursor position preserved | ✗ | ✓ |
| Speed | Slow | Instant |

---

## History Search

### Reverse Incremental Search (Ctrl+R)

Search backwards through command history as you type. Just like bash/zsh.

### Keybinding

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+R` | Enter reverse search mode |
| `Ctrl+R` (in search) | Find next match |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel search |
| `Enter` | Accept and execute |
| `Backspace` | Edit search query |

### How It Works

1. Press `Ctrl+R` to enter search mode
2. Type search query - matches appear in real-time
3. Press `Ctrl+R` again to find next older match
4. Press `Enter` to use the command
5. Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel

### Example Session

```bash
# Press Ctrl+R
(reverse-i-search)`': _

# Type "dock"
(reverse-i-search)`dock': docker ps -a

# Press Ctrl+R to find next match
(reverse-i-search)`dock': docker build -t myapp .

# Press Ctrl+R again
(reverse-i-search)`dock': docker run -d --name web nginx

# Press Enter to use this command
den> docker run -d --name web nginx
```

### Search Features

- **Substring matching:** Matches anywhere in command
- **Case-sensitive:** Search respects case
- **Real-time:** Updates as you type
- **Backwards search:** Starts from most recent
- **Multiple matches:** Cycle with repeated Ctrl+R

### Advanced Usage

#### Search by Arguments
```bash
# Find all commands with specific flag
(reverse-i-search)`--verbose': npm run build --verbose
```

#### Search by Command
```bash
# Find specific git command
(reverse-i-search)`git commit': git commit -m "feat: add feature"
```

#### Refine Search
```bash
# Start with broad search
(reverse-i-search)`docker': docker run nginx

# Add more characters to narrow down
(reverse-i-search)`docker run': docker run -d nginx

# Even more specific
(reverse-i-search)`docker run -d': docker run -d --name web nginx
```

### Tips & Tricks

- **Combine with history:** Ctrl+R for recent, Up arrow for sequential
- **Short queries:** Start with 2-3 characters, refine if needed
- **Common patterns:** Search for flags/options to find similar commands
- **Edit after accept:** Accepting a match puts it in the buffer for editing

## Tips for Maximum Efficiency

### 1. Learn Word Navigation First
Most impactful feature. Start using Ctrl+Left/Right today.

### 2. Use Ctrl+T for Typos
Faster than backspace for transposed letters.

### 3. Combine Commands
- Navigate with Ctrl+Left/Right
- Delete with Ctrl+W or Alt+D
- Fix with Ctrl+T

### 4. Use Ctrl+R for History
Better than Up arrow for finding old commands.

### 5. Keep Screen Clean
Ctrl+L before important output keeps terminal readable.

### 6. Practice the Patterns
- Jump backward, delete word (Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+W)
- Jump forward, delete word (Ctrl+Right, Alt+D)
- Fix typo in place (Navigate, Ctrl+T)

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Delete Middle Word
```
Ctrl+Left (to word) → Ctrl+W (delete it)
```

### Pattern 2: Replace Middle Word
```
Ctrl+Left (to word) → Ctrl+W (delete) → type new word
```

### Pattern 3: Fix Typo
```
Ctrl+Left/Right (to typo) → Ctrl+T (swap)
```

### Pattern 4: Clean and Search
```
Ctrl+L (clear) → Ctrl+R (search)
```

### Pattern 5: Delete Rest of Line
```
Ctrl+Left/Right (to position) → Ctrl+K (kill to end)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Ctrl+Left/Right Not Working?

Some terminals send different escape sequences. Try:
- Use `Alt+B` / `Alt+F` instead
- Check terminal settings for "Option as Meta key"
- Verify terminal emulation is correct

### Alt+D Not Working?

MacOS issue - Option key might not be set as Meta:
- iTerm2: Preferences → Profiles → Keys → Set Option as Meta
- Terminal.app: Preferences → Profiles → Keyboard → Use Option as Meta

### Ctrl+R Shows Nothing?

History might be empty:
- Run some commands first
- Check history file exists
- Verify history is being saved

### Transpose Not Working as Expected?

Cursor position matters:
- Must be after at least one character
- At end of line: swaps last two chars
- In middle: swaps char before and at cursor
