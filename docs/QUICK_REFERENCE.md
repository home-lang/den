# Den Shell Quick Reference

A quick reference guide for Den's interactive features and keyboard shortcuts.

## Tab Completion

### Basic Completion
```bash
# Complete commands
git st<TAB>      → git status

# Complete files
cat READ<TAB>    → cat README.md

# Complete directories (adds /)
cd Doc<TAB>      → cd Documents/
```

### Multiple Suggestions
```bash
cd /usr/l<TAB>
# Shows:  lib/  libexec/  local/

# Press TAB again to cycle through options
# Currently selected option is highlighted
```

### Mid-Word Path Expansion (zsh-style)
```bash
# Type abbreviations, get full paths
/u/l/b<TAB>           → /usr/local/bin/
~/D/P/d<TAB>          → ~/Documents/Projects/den/
./s/u/c<TAB>          → ./src/utils/completion.zig

# Works even with ambiguous segments!
/u/l/s<TAB>           → /usr/local/share/
# (even though /usr/l matches lib, libexec, local)
```

### Git Command Completion
```bash
# Complete git subcommands
git st<TAB>           → git status
git che<TAB>          → Shows: checkout, cherry-pick

# Complete branch names
git checkout <TAB>    → Shows all branches (local and remote)
git merge main<TAB>   → git merge main

# Complete modified files
git add <TAB>         → Shows modified/untracked files
git diff src/<TAB>    → Shows modified files in src/

# Supported commands:
# Branches: checkout, branch, merge, rebase, switch, cherry-pick
# Files: add, diff, restore, reset
```

For complete details, see [Git Completion Guide](GIT_COMPLETION.md).

## History Navigation

### Basic History
```bash
Up Arrow     # Previous command
Down Arrow   # Next command
```

### History Substring Search
```bash
# Type part of a command, then press Up/Down
# to filter history by substring

den> git<Up>
# Shows only commands containing "git"
den> git commit -m "fix bug"

den> docker<Up>
# Shows only commands containing "docker"
den> docker ps -a
```

**Features:**
- Matches substring anywhere in command (not just at start)
- Press Up/Down to navigate through matches
- Press Down past last match to return to search query
- Type any character to exit search mode

### Reverse Incremental Search (Ctrl+R)
```bash
# Press Ctrl+R to enter reverse search mode
den>
(reverse-i-search)`': _

# Type to search backwards through history
(reverse-i-search)`dock': docker ps -a

# Press Ctrl+R again to find next match
(reverse-i-search)`dock': docker build -t myapp .

# Press Enter to use the command
den> docker build -t myapp .

# Or press Ctrl+C to cancel
```

**Features:**
- Real-time incremental search as you type
- Searches backwards from most recent
- Press Ctrl+R repeatedly to cycle through matches
- Shows matching command with search term highlighted
- Backspace to edit search query
- Just like bash/zsh!

## Advanced Line Editing

### Word Navigation
Navigate by words instead of characters for faster editing:

```bash
# Type a long command
den> git commit -m "Add new feature to the authentication system"
                      ^cursor here

# Jump back one word (Ctrl+Left or Alt+B)
den> git commit -m "Add new feature to the authentication system"
                  ^jumped to "new"

# Jump forward one word (Ctrl+Right or Alt+F)
den> git commit -m "Add new feature to the authentication system"
                          ^jumped to "feature"
```

**Pro tip:** Use word navigation to quickly fix mistakes in the middle of long commands!

### Delete Word Forward (Alt+D)
Delete from cursor to end of next word:

```bash
den> git commit -m "fix typo error in function"
              ^cursor here

# Press Alt+D
den> git commit -m "fix  error in function"
              ^deleted "typo "

# Press Alt+D again
den> git commit -m "fix  in function"
              ^deleted "error "
```

**Use case:** Quickly remove words without backspacing or selecting.

### Transpose Characters (Ctrl+T)
Fix common typos instantly by swapping characters:

```bash
# Oops, typed "teh" instead of "the"
den> echo teh
          ^cursor here

# Press Ctrl+T
den> echo the
         ^fixed! cursor moved forward
```

```bash
# Also works at end of line
den> echo hello wordl
                     ^cursor at end

# Press Ctrl+T (swaps last two chars)
den> echo hello world
                     ^fixed!
```

**Pro tip:** Ctrl+T is the fastest way to fix transposed letters. Much faster than backspace!

### Clear Screen (Ctrl+L)
Clear the terminal and get a fresh prompt without losing your current command:

```bash
# After lots of output...
den> ls -la
total 48
drwxr-xr-x  12 user  staff   384 Nov  9 10:30 .
drwxr-xr-x   8 user  staff   256 Nov  8 15:22 ..
[... many more lines ...]

den> git status
# More output...

# Press Ctrl+L - screen clears and you get fresh prompt
den> _
```

**Use case:** Keep your terminal clean while working without losing your command history.

## Quick Tips

### Tip 1: Fast Directory Navigation
```bash
# Instead of:
cd /usr/local/share/
# Type:
cd /u/l/s<TAB>
```

### Tip 2: Find Commands in History
```bash
# Instead of pressing Up repeatedly, type part of the command:
den> docker<Up>
# Instantly shows matching docker commands
```

### Tip 3: Cycle Through Suggestions
```bash
# Don't memorize paths - cycle through options:
cd Documents/<TAB><TAB><TAB>
# Cycles: Projects/ → Work/ → Personal/ → ...
```

### Tip 4: Complete Hidden Files
```bash
# Start with dot to show hidden files:
ls .<TAB>
# Shows: .bashrc  .gitignore  .config/
```

### Tip 5: Search by Arguments
```bash
# Find commands by their flags:
den> --verbose<Up>
# Shows all commands you ran with --verbose
```

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Exploring a New Project
```bash
# Navigate quickly
cd /u/l/s/app/j<TAB>  → cd /usr/local/share/applications/java/

# List what's there
ls <TAB>
# Cycle through suggestions to explore

# Open files
vim sr<TAB>  → vim src/
```

### Workflow 2: Repeating Commands
```bash
# Find that complex docker command
den> docker run<Up>
# Cycle through previous docker run commands

# Find by specific flag
den> --name myapp<Up>
# Shows commands with --name myapp
```

### Workflow 3: File Operations
```bash
# Quick copy with completion
cp ~/D/P/d/R<TAB>  →  cp ~/Documents/Projects/den/README.md

# Move with abbreviation
mv /t/d/f<TAB> ./  →  mv /tmp/downloads/file.txt ./
```

## Environment

### Current Directory
```bash
pwd                  # Print working directory
cd -                # Go to previous directory
cd ~                # Go to home directory
cd                  # Go to home directory (same as cd ~)
```

### Path Completion Contexts

Den knows what to complete based on command:
```bash
cd <TAB>            # Only directories
ls <TAB>            # Files and directories
cat <TAB>           # Files and directories
mkdir <TAB>         # No completion (you're creating a new dir)
```

## Advanced Examples

### Example 1: Complex Path Navigation
```bash
# Navigate to deep directory in one step
cd /u/l/s/f/t/d/c<TAB>
# Expands to: /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/confavail/
```

### Example 2: Finding Old Commands
```bash
# You remember running a curl command with specific headers
den> Content-Type<Up>
# Shows: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" ...
```

### Example 3: Exploring Command Options
```bash
# What git commands have I used?
git <TAB>
# Shows all git subcommands

# Cycle through to remind yourself
git <TAB><TAB><TAB>
# Cycles through: status → commit → push → pull → ...
```

## Customization (Coming Soon)

Future configuration options:
```bash
# ~/.den/config.json (planned)
{
  "completion": {
    "style": "cycle",           # or "menu"
    "columns": 4,               # columns in suggestion list
    "case_sensitive": false,    # case-insensitive completion
    "fuzzy_match": true,        # fuzzy path matching
    "show_hidden": false        # show hidden files by default
  },
  "history": {
    "substring_search": true,   # enable substring search
    "case_sensitive": false,    # case-insensitive search
    "max_entries": 10000        # history size
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Completion not working?
1. Type more characters to narrow down options
2. Check file/directory permissions
3. Verify path exists: `ls /u/l/b`

### History search not finding commands?
1. Check spelling (search is case-sensitive)
2. Make sure command is in history: `history | grep docker`
3. Verify substring exists in command

### Mid-word expansion not working?
1. Path must be unique through all segments
2. Test with: `den complete "/u/l/b"`
3. Check directory permissions
